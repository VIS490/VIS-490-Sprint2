The Team Leaders can then see the average of the overall Team‚Äôs mental wellbeing score keeping users anonymous.  Users can see their own past historical data as well , helping them continue to grow. Please note that this app is not  HIPAA compliant and this is a prototype

```
This will download all the requirements for you Flask-Socketio-Python Backend Application

Step 3
```sh
yarn or npm install
```
This will download all the requirements for you React-Socketio Frontend Application
Step 4
```sh
touch .env
```
Run the Command above, to make a env file, in your root project directory

Step 5
```sh
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=*****
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=*****
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=*****
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=*****
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=*****
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=*****
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=*****
REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=*****
REACT_APP_HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET=*****
```
This is your env file
- All you keys will be in this .env file
- All firebase, hasura keys will in here

## Setting Up Firebase
- Start by going to ``Firebase`` site and create a project
- Make and account and click ``Get Started``, then click ``Add project``
- Give you app a Name, select ``Default Account for Firebase``, finally click Create Project!
- On the Home Page select, the option ``Web App``, give you app a name
- Firebase will give the ``Firebase SDK`` take the values of the variables and add them to the ``.env`` file exactly
- After this, your app will be connected to Firebase
- Enable Google Auth and Sign in with Email/Password in the Firebase
## Setting Up Hasura
- Create a New Project, pick a region closest to you, and give it a name
- Next Step is to set up a db, now you have to Sign Up with Heroku and create project with a Postgress DB, I have linked the Heroku docs above
- Input put the DB URL, which you get with Heroku and create the app
```sh
HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET = {
    "type":"RS256",
    "jwk_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com",
    "audience": "<firebase-project-id>",
    "issuer": "https://securetoken.google.com/<firebase-project-id>"
}
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET = youradminsecret
```
- You need add these variables in the ``Config Vars in Heroku``
- These will enable you to make Hasura GraphQL Queries and Mutations
- The next is to make your DB tables in Hasura
- ``tables_ddl.pdf`` this a file with all the Tables which can be used to make the Database
- Use the SQL file to make your tables
## Run the App
- Open the App in VSCODE or any other editor
- Run Commands
```sh
npm run dev 
```
```sh
python app.py
```
## Issues (Obstacles)
- Firebase Integration
- Hasura Query and Mutations
- UI Styling for Components
- Datbase Schema connections between tables 
- Signup bugs - fixing edge cases 

## Issues Still Persist
- Did not calculate  the average of scores via Hasura
